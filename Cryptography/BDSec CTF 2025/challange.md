We intercepted an encrypted message from a suspicious server. Our intelligence suggests that they're using a time-based encryption scheme, where the encryption key is generated by hashing the exact timestamp using a widely known message-digest algorithm.

Hint : Check server logs for the exact encryption time. Some ciphers age with time, in this one, each letter is influenced by the clock's fingerprint and its place in line. Digits dance in hex, shifting more as they march forward.

#### Message : INNVC{rJXKrb_FFg_NFTx_FMHDWFmX!!}

**Flag Format : BDSEC{something}**

Timestamp like this : 2000, 3, 13, 17, 20, 0 (YYYY,M,DD,HH,mm,ss)

Hints: Maybe try tracing the heartbeat of March 15 The encryption isn’t just about letters it’s about time. The exact second the message was encrypted determines how each letter shifts. A common hash algorithm turns that moment into a repeating pattern and the position of each letter adds a twist.
