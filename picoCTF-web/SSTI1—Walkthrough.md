In this article, I will go through my thought process and the steps I took to complete my first PicoCTF challenge, which is the Web Exploitation SSTI1 challenge. SSTI stands for Server-side Template Injection, which is a type of vulnerability where an attacker injects malicious template expressions into input fields that gets processed by the serverâ€™s template engine. [This vulnerability causes risks such as information disclosure, remote code execution (RCE) and could grant access to sensitive server-side data such as user data, configuration files and session tokens stored in server memory.](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/18-Testing_for_Server-side_Template_Injection?) Hence why it is crucial to put measures in place to prevent such attacks.
